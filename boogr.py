  <summary>
    Provides exception wrapping and SQLite-backed exception logging for Mathy.

    Purpose:
        Defines the lightweight Error wrapper used throughout Mathy exception handlers and the
        Logger utility used to persist wrapped exception details to the configured SQLite logging
        database. The module centralizes error metadata capture so fetchers, loaders, processors,
        scrapers, and tool adapters can report failures consistently without duplicating database
        setup or traceback extraction logic.

		Captures the original exception, traceback text, optional heading, cause, module name,

		object that can be raised by calling code and written by the Logger without requiring
		each caller to format traceback details manually.

		heading (str | None): Optional display heading associated with the error.
		cause (str | None): Logical component or class responsible for the failure.
		method (str | None): Stable method or function signature where the failure occurred.
		module (str | None): Source module where the failure occurred.
		type (type | None): Active exception type reported by ``sys.exc_info``.
