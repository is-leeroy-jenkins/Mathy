## 🧠 Overview

**Mathy** is a clean abstraction over clustering algorithms, preprocessing tools, 
and classification/regression models with custom wrappers, error handling, and diagnostic tools for 
machine-learning workflows. Mathy targets professionals in data science and analytics who require reusable, robust, and 
interpretable tools for building intelligent models—especially within government and research domains.
